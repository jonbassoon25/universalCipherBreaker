Created by Jonathan Hanson

The purpose of this project is to expand the compatability of cipherBreaker to be able to break more than one type of cipher
To do this, much of the code from cipherBreaker has been altered
In the process, it has also been optimized for faster data creation and training

Currently Supported Ciphers:
  -  Caesar
  -  Zac's
  -  Custom (mine)
  -  Uncompressed Custom (mine without variablility in length)
